# Dominatrix

A drop-in package for the LaTeX typesetting system that implements best-practices and fixes recommended by the community-at-large.

## Introduction

## Quick Start

Make sure you have LaTeX installed on your system and that you can compile `.tex` files to `.pdf` or `.dvi`, whichever is your poison. If you haven't done that, we recommend:

+ [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) for Windows
+ [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/) for OS X

Thanks to contributions from a great community, both work out-of-the-box or with very little configuration on your part. We also assume that you have a functional knowledge of how LaTeX works, in which case if you don't, we recommend:

+ [LaTeX WikiBook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
+ [LaTeX Community](http://www.latex-community.org/forum/)

To use Dominatrix, just require the package in your preamble:

```latex
\RequirePackage{dominatrix}
\begin{document}
\end{document}
```

That's it! You do not need to declare the document class, e.g. `\documentclass{article}` because Dominatrix does that for you.

**Since you'll hopefully be using Dominatrix as a starter for all your documents, we recommend that you put Dominatrix in a directory with a globally accessible path, or in a location which is sufficiently high-up in the file-hierarchy for you to access it easily.**

## Features

Package-by-package details are due to come in for this very soon. Until then, read the comments in dominatrix.sty!

### Core Functionality

Dominatrix requires LaTeX2e to work. You should be already on this version if your install is reasonably fresh (e.g. if you didn't pull the computer out of a modern day archeological dig site).

Dominatrix uses the [KOMA-script](http://www.ctex.org/documents/packages/nonstd/koma-script.pdf) package as a replacement for LaTeX's default `article` class. This introduces a number of layout fixes and generally makes everything look better. KOMA-script also removes the need for you to forcibly break every line. In other words:

```latex
Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet \\

Consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

can now be written as:

```latex
Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet

Consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

to produce the same output.

We use the [fixltx2e](http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/base/fixltx2e.pdf) package as a polyfill for known bugs in LaTeX2e until the LaTeX Working Group releases LaTeX3.

### Fonts

*Font Size*
We fix the font-size at 11pt by default. At and below 10pt, printers or monitors without subpixel anti-aliasing may have difficulty reproducing text for legibility. At 12pt you get text that is a bit bigger in exchange for less paper efficiency, though this may be preferred by some institutions. Change it to fit your needs!

## Core Dependencies

+ [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)
+ [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/)
+ [Miso Font](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Miso)

## Versioning

Development will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible in order to ensure transparency and backwards compatibility.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

+ Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
+ New additions without breaking backward compatibility bump the minor (and resets the patch)
+ Bug fixes and miscellaneous changes bump the patch

## Changelog

**v1.0.0**

+ Implements common fixes for LaTeX2e and community recommended packages.

## Roadmap

+ Convert Miso from a fontspec dependency to a native LaTeX font
+ Add documentation and links for/to the individual packages in Dominatrix
+ Build up logic and decision-making within the package
+ Explore precompiling static components in the package
